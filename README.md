# CPIMC2020

New Implementation of the CPIMC Method

## what works

- non-interacting electron gas, canonical ensemble, 3D


## what doesn't / todo

- at small T: no unoccupied orbitals to move to available for particles deep inside the fermi sphere (proposal radius too small)

- calculate how often each type of update is proposed/accepted/rejected
