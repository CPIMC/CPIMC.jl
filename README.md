# CPIMC2020

New Implementation of the CPIMC Method

## what works

- non-interacting electron gas, canonical ensemble, arbitrary dimensions (up to 3)


## what doesn't / todo

- ~~at small T: no unoccupied orbitals to move to available for particles deep inside the fermi sphere (proposal radius too small)~~

- ~~calculate how often each type of update is proposed/accepted/rejected~~

- get_beta_internal only works in 3D
